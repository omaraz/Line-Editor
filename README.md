# Line-Editor
Line Editor an application on Keyboard Buffer using C++

keyboard buffer is a small area in the computer's memory (RAM) that is used to temporarily store the keystrokes from the keyboard before they are processed by the CPU.So in summary, the seed phrase is the "seed" that creates everything else (and is easy to store/remember), the extended key is your "master key", and the normal key (now called a spending key) derives from the extended key and lets you spend your funds. Also note that the terminology differs a bit between eras.

So an application to use it we select a simple chosen key some extended 2 Bytes First is NULL and second is a value in this code  (-> right arrow, <- left arrow , Home, End ) other are Normal Keys(Esc, Enter).

Extended key:
-> right arrow : Move one place to the right in the same line in the console.
<- left arrow  : Move one place to left in the same line in the console.
Home : Move to first char in the same line in the console.
End : Move to last elemnt in the same line in the console.

Normal Key:
Esc : will give a notice and then exit the program.
Enter : Will print the characters in the array in a new line and move the x ,y into the new lines.

This code to work on GCC or the new version like Visual Studio or CodeBlocks may need some changes.
